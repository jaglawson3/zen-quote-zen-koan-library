    "'The essence of your mind is not born, so it will never die. It is not an " +
    "existence, which is perishable. It is not an emptiness, which is a mere void." +
    " It has neither color nor form. It enjoys no pleasures and suffers no pains." +
    "I know you are very ill. Liek a good Zen student, you are facing that sickness" +
    " squarely. You may not know exactly who is suffering, but question yourself:" +
    " What is the essence of this mind? Think only of this. You will need no more." +
    " Covet nothing. Your end which is endless is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air."

    "right. You may somewhere else to study if ou wish, but this poor brother " +

    "going to keep him here even if all the rest of you leave.' A torrent of " +
